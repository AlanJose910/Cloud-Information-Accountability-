&nbsp;&nbsp; Provable data possession (PDP) is a technique for ensuring the integrity of data in 
                storage outsourcing. In this paper, we address the construction of an efficient 
                PDP scheme for distributed cloud storage to support the scalability of service 
                and data migration, in which we consider the existence of multiple cloud service 
                providers to cooperatively store and maintain the clients’ data. We present a 
                cooperative PDP (CPDP) scheme based on homomorphic verifiable response and hash 
                index hierarchy. We prove the security of our scheme based on multi-proverS 
                zero-knowledge proof system, which can satisfy completeness, knowledge 
                soundness, and zero-knowledge properties. In addition, we articulate performance 
                optimization mechanisms for our scheme, and in particular present an efficient 
                method for selecting optimal parameter values to minimize the computation costs 
                of clients and storage service providers. Our experiments show that our solution 
                introduces lower computation and communication overheads in comparison with 
                non-cooperative approaches.</td>
